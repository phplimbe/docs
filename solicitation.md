# Solicitation Guidelines

The goal of our meetup is to create a safe community for web developers in Limburg to meet other peers, exchange ideas, 
and learn. To that effect, we think it's essential that our events avoid becoming too "corporate" (which is why we rotate 
sponsors and venues), and that our attendees don't get spammed with recruitment offers. The following guidelines are meant 
to avoid that kind of spam.

1. Companies or individuals are not allowed to do any kind of mass-solicitation during an event. Examples of mass solicitation: 
distributing flyers, leaving a stack of business cards on a table, announcing to everyone that you're hiring, or even going 
from one person to the other with the sole purpose of announcing your offers.

2. They're also not allowed to use any of the online tools from meetup.com for mass-solicitation, including photo uploads or 
comments. 

3. However, "private solicitation" is allowed as long as it's tactful. Roughly what that means is: if you engage on a "1 on 1" 
conversation with another attendee, and the conversation naturally steers towards an opportunity to solicit, then that's just 
"barely OK": we would still prefer that you become a sponsor instead! :)

3. The only exception: companies or individuals who are sponsoring a specific event are allowed mass-solicitation privileges 
for that specific event only: that means they can distribute flyers, make an announcement, etc, but only during the specific 
event that they're sponsoring.

If you're interested in becoming a sponsor please feel free to contact one of the organizers through the tools available at
